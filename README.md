# Standalone Hive Metastore

DEPRECATED: Now embeded in kdc01

This project to run the Hive metastore locally, or to embed it in a container.

Although public, this project is not currently documented and may still host some infrastructure specifics configuration.

This project is inspired by <https://medium.com/@adamrempter/running-spark-3-with-standalone-hive-metastore-3-0-b7dfa733de91> and <https://github.com/arempter/hive-metastore-docker>. Thanks to him.
